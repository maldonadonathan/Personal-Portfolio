            <h2>Letters of Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the most influential people in my life have been my instructors. Mrs. Allen, Ms. Crossman, and Madame Havens have gone beyond teaching me, and I am eternally grateful for their impact on my life. Their letters of recommendation mean the world
                to me, and I am glad to have known them as a student. I hope to make them proud in my future endeavors.
            </p>

                <h2>Mrs. Allen</h2>
                <p><b>September 13, 2021</b></p>
                <p><b>Dear Sirs,</b></p>
                <p>It is with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation for Nathan Maldonado. I have had the pleasure of knowing Nathan for the last four years as his computer Science teacher, his advisory for robotics and his supervisor
                    for internships. He came to me with a wealth of knowledge in the Computer Science world and strives to learn even more each day, demonstrating a keen ability to take his knowledge of computer science and apply it to data science and
                    cognitive science applications.</p>
                <p>Nathan is a quiet and respectful young man with a passion for learning, but don’t let his demeaner sway you that he anything less than brilliant. His academic resume would make any parent proud with a 4.61 GPA loaded with “A”s in AP and
                    honors courses on his transcript. What is absent from his transcript is what an amazing young man he is. Nathan is a kind soul who is wicked smart. He has the propensity for learning concepts well beyond his peers but doesn’t make
                    them feel that way. He works well alone and in groups, he is an amazing listener and when he chimes in with opinions, it’s usually a conversation stopper because what he shares surpasses what his peers have thought of. He is kind,
                    caring and doesn’t mind helping out his seatmates when they get stuck. His passion for doing his best is evident in everything he does. I have watched as he takes classroom concepts to a new level and applies them to real-world settings,
                    just for fun. As an educator, I can’t wait to see what he will accomplish in his college career. As a human, I can’t wait to see how he is going to change the world.</p>
                <p>When Nathan isn’t delving into his studies, he is busy making positive impacts in his community. He is actively involved in the Red Cross in multiple capacities. He has served as a volunteer, helping match fire victims to available service;
                    a collector of emergency necessities for wildfire victims; and as an ambassador for the Red Cross’ International Humanitarian Law campaign, informing students across our district how the edict of war relates to the contemporary world.
                    He is also a founding member of Leap XR, an educational company started by Clovis North students that programs virtual reality environments to help educate our special needs students in needed life skills. Nathan also holds a leadership
                    positions in the Coding club and the school’s FIRST Robotics Competition team, Stable Circuits. Well-rounded is an understatement when describing Nathan.</p>
                <p>I have no doubt that Nathan has much to bring to any college campus and yet can learn so much from others as well. He is an outstanding choice and I ask you to strongly consider inviting him into your fold. Please contact me if you desire
                    any further information about this amazing young man.</p>
                <p><b>Kind Regards,</b></p>

                <h2>Ms. Crossman</h2>
                <p><b>To Whom It May Concern:</b></p>
                <p>I offer my highest recommendation for Mr. Nathan Maldonado. I had the pleasure of serving as Nathan’s AP Psychology teacher last year, and among the 180 students I taught, Nathan was a stand-out individual from the start. Nathan is beyond
                    outstanding as both a student and a person. He is by far one of the brightest and most intellectual students I have taught. Nathan’s unique ability to contextualize the content we learned in a large-scale approach often left me awestruck.
                    In addition to his academic excellence, Nathan is extremely witty and funny. Nathan would often email me jokes and memes with psychology related content, or funny retorts to classroom conversations that demonstrated his deep understanding
                    of the topic. Nathan has continued to make his mark on this campus by being an exemplary student and kind person to those around him, even during a time when face-to-face contact was not an option. However, what truly sets Nathan apart
                    from the rest is his natural inclination to think widely, ask piercing questions, and perpetually emote kindness and generosity.</p>
                <p>In the academic setting, Nathan excels. Out of 618 students in his senior class, Nathan is ranked as #27, which should come as no surprise to those who are privileged enough to know him. Nathan is not only naturally gifted; he puts in
                    hard work in order to succeed at the levels in which he is performing. During his four years here at Clovis North, Nathan has taken 10 AP courses, and 5 honors courses, a heavy course load for any student. Moreover, in order to maximize
                    cost and time efficiency during college, Nathan has also taken 8 courses at the community college. Though this may seem excessive to some, Nathan’s natural capabilities and drive have kept him successful amid the extensive demands
                    of a heavy course load. During him time at university, I am certain he will thrive within every environment he finds himself.</p>
                <p>Though Nathan is extremely academically successful, he has not had everything come easy to him. While most students at Clovis North are white, with medium to high income families, Nathan comes from a low-income Latino family and two immigrant
                    parents. As the first-born son in a family with no college graduates, Nathan has had to pave his own way towards academic success, navigating between Mexican and American cultural norms, AP courses and Honors classes, and college admissions
                    all on his own. In my opinion, Nathan has been able to achieve this by making connections with his peers, and more importantly, his teachers. Moreover, Nathan has immersed himself in various extra- curriculars, such as the Coding Club,
                    the Red Cross, the International Humanitarian Law, Robotics, and LEAP, an LLC which helps students with special needs by editing their curriculum. Though Nathan’s life has not been without adversity, he has always worked to put more
                    into the world than what he takes. I am certain he will continue to contribute to his communities throughout the rest of his college career and his entire life.</p>
                <p>In sum, Nathan was truly a joy to have as my student. For anyone lucky enough to meet him, I am confident they will come to the same conclusion. He is without question, an asset to have in any community. For these reasons, I offer my full
                    support for Nathan Maldonado.</p>
                <p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>

                <h2>Madame Havens</h2>
                <p><b>Re: Nathan Maldonado</b></p>
                <p><b>March 15, 2022</b></p>
                <p><b>Dear Scholarship Selection Committee:</b></p>
                <p>It is my distinct pleasure to write this letter of recommendation in support of Mr. Nathan Maldonado. As a teacher of college preparation courses for the past twenty-five years, I have had the true honor of teaching many of our brightest
                    students, and I can say without hesitation that Nathan is one of the most exceptional students that I have ever had the pleasure of teaching. He is an extremely reliable and responsible young man who always brings to class an inquisitive
                    mind and enthusiasm for learning. I am confident that Nathan will represent your organization with grace and honor.</p>
                <p>Academically, Nathan's outstanding performance speaks for itself. His transcript is most impressive, and he has maintained a high level of academic achievement while taking a full load of difficult courses. Through diligence and hard work,
                    Nathan has been one of the top students in my very competitive French III and AP French Language and Culture courses over the past two years. Nathan is genuinely curious about how the language works and often stays after class to discuss
                    the nuances of the language and sends me questions when he encounters a real-life French application outside of the school setting that he wants to know more about. It is a joy for a teacher to see a student internalizing and applying
                    their subject matter! Nathan's intrinsic interest in French not only makes him a better student, it inspires me to be a better teacher.</p>
                <p>Further, Nathan is truly a joyful, thoughtful, and humble young man who is a classroom leader every day. He is an invaluable member of our class, and never hesitates to help others. He expertly guides and encourages his classmates to success
                    with his patience and true understanding of the concepts taught in class. Nathan's kind and collaborative nature make him very easy to work with and students seek him out for help when they are struggling with difficult material. Nathan
                    gives freely of his time and knowledge and he is always positive and supportive, never condescending. Through his obvious love of learning and by being a stellar human being, Nathan leads by example, the most powerful of all leadership
                    styles.
                </p>
                <p>Another of Nathan's outstanding qualities is that he is an out-of-the box thinker. This year, because it was in direct conflict with my AP French Language course in which he was enrolled, Nathan was not able to enroll in our AP Spanish
                    Language course as he hoped. At this point, having already exceeded the minimum foreign language requirement for college admission, he could have taken the easy road and opted out of one (or both!) of the languages - Nevermind that
                    he was not required to take an extra class, much less two, due to his commitments in our CART Program! - Instead, Nathan proposed enrolling in Ap French and AP Spanish at the same time, splitting his time between the courses. Normally
                    I would have said no to this request, as part-time world language courses are rarely successful. However, due to Nathan's interest in languages, his impeccable organizational skills, and his dedication to academic success, I was confident
                    that he would follow through and complete both courses with great results. After having him in class last year, I knew that I could count on Nathan to pace himself appropriately and complete all of the tasks and assessments that I
                    was assigning to the rest of the class without any external pressure and with very little input or guidance from me. For the record, he is earning an A in both courses! Nathan is the kind of student who makes a teacher's job simple,
                    raising the bar for everyone whether he is, or is not, physically in the room.</p>
                <p>It is with the utmost pride and without hesitation that I recommend Mr. Nathan Maldonado. I am confident that he will manage the rigor, pace, and opportunities of university life as he does everything - with passion, diligence, and kindness.
                    You will be proud, should Nathan be chosen as part of your organization; you will be making a significant, positive impact in his life, and he will truly value and appreciate your support.</p>
                <p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>
