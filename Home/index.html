            Welcome, everyone, my name is Nathan Maldonado, and I am a senior at Clovis North High School and soon-to-be first-year student at Duke University. I am an FGLI (first-generation, low-income) student, and I am the oldest in my family with two younger
            siblings. I currently reside in Fresno, California, but I previously lived in Los Angeles, California, before high school. I am incredibly family-oriented, so I spend much of my free time at various amusement parks with them or watching psychological
            thrillers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since moving to the Central Valley, I have taken an interest in artificial intelligence and have enrolled in my high school robotics team and coding club, so I intend to study computer science and linguistics at Duke. In my first year of high school,
            I won the Let Your Invention Fly Challenge competition hosted by NASA and California State University, Fresno. However, my interest in computer science is derived from my ethnic heritage: K'iche' Maya. K'iche' is an indigenous language spoken
            in Guatemala, and very few educational tools exist to preserve the language, so I intend to utilize my background in computer science and artificial intelligence to create technology that does just that. Furthermore, I encourage you to navigate
            toward my previous works, notably my personal statement and tourism website. Don't hesitate to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmaldonado/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:nmaldonado2725@gmail.com">email</a>            if you have any concerns or are interested in hearing more about my experiences; I would love to answer all questions!
        </p>
