        <h2>Journal</h2>
        <p>Part of being a web developer, and any other form of a computer scientist for that matter, requires organization. As I completed my digital portfolio, I wrote all the work I had contributed for that day in a daily log. I kept the record below
            to keep me on task and disciplined. I encourage you to look if you are interested in seeing how I have kept myself busy as I complete my senior year of high school.</p>

        <h3>Wednesday, April 20, 2022</h3>
        <p>I started the project by reading the requirements and evaluating what was expected of me upon completion of the project. I then continued by organizing the pages I wanted to include on my website and the works I wanted to display and highlight.
            I then completed research on how other brands and individuals created their overall displays and how their personalities could be conveyed in their websites. I investigated five different websites, and I will continue to complete five tomorrow
            for a total of ten.
        </p>
        <h3>Thursday, April 21, 2022</h3>
        <p>I completed my investigation in other examples of digital portfolios and how website developers would demonstrate professionalism in their sites while still maintaining a playful personality. Secondly, I began considering how I wanted the overall
            website mood to feel.
        </p>
        <h3>Friday, April 22, 2022</h3>
        <p>A mood board is composed of various images, fonts; and colors collected on an single document that is meant to guide the overall color scheme and organization of a website. Therefore, today, I completed mine for my digital portfolio and evaluated
            how this would be achieved if I still wanted to keep a professional image of myself.
        </p>
        <h3>Monday, April 25, 2022</h3>
        <p>I began to gather the texts I would need for my digital portfolio documents, including my letters of recommendation from my teachers and my resume, updating it to match my current objective.
        </p>
        <h3>Tuesday April 26, 2022</h3>
        <p>Today, I began to complete the text that would appear on the various pages of my portfolio, including introductions to some of my works and what they meant to me in the process of completion.
        </p>
        <h3>Wednesday, April 27, 2022</h3>
        <p>I finalized a Figma wireframe of how I wanted my website to appear on a desktop, tablet, and mobile device. Secondly, I made a note on where each of the buttons and navigation bar would travel to on the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Thursday, April 28, 2022</h3>
        <p>Today, I created each of the files and the skeleton of my website. While I know that I will ultimately make changes to the site appearance and structure, I am confident that I am at a good point to also include all my tagged text and buttons.
        </p>
        <h3>Friday, April 29, 2022</h3>
        <p>Today, I began searching for each of the images that I will be utilizing throughout my portfolio, including photos of my previous works and other miscellaneous ones to add a warming visual appeal and proper user experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Monday, May 2, 2022</h3>
        <p>I was unfortunately unable to contribute anything on my project because I was taking the AP U.S. Government exam at my high school during the time I would have normally been at CART.
        </p>
        <h3>Tuesday, May 3, 2022</h3>
        <p>Today, I began research into styling my website. While I originally had a plan and mood board that made use of dark and cool blues and reds, I now feel that these will be too harsh and an unpleasant visual experience with too much contrast. Instead,
            I am considering making a website with more pleasant and lighter blues and pinks.
        </p>
        <h3>Wednesday, May 4, 2022</h3>
        <p>With the color scheme now settled after having looked and examined other portfolios, I was now at a place to begin styling my website. I began with the navigation bar at the top of my website as this was my primary source of trouble in previous
            works. Once I return from AP testing, I am sure to finalize the appearance of it.
        </p>
        <h3>Thursday, May 5, 2022</h3>
        <p>Like Monday, I was unable to work on my personal portfolio project because I was taking the AP Macroeconomics exam, but I am sure I will be able to keep up with the deadlines and workload.
        </p>
        <h3>Friday, May 6, 2022</h3>
        <p>Today, I continued to work on the navigation bar for my project, and I have gotten to a healthy point in my project to where I feel everything is coming together. However, I am now having the issue of putting my name on one line separate from
            the rest of the navigation.
