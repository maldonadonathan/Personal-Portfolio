        <p>
            As a student at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), I was tasked with creating a website that would introduce myself to my classmates. I used Adobe Spark Pages to make the site and found free-use and royalty-free images through Pexels.
            The information I included on my site ranges from a background of myself to my long-term goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of the project requirements stated that I would have to explain each image and have context for them during a professional presentation. I would introduce another classmate through their website. While I found that I could provide simplistic information,
            I knew that I wanted to make an impression on my classmates and instructors, so I went beyond and ensured that all the text and images I included flowed together and detailed a story about myself the way an autobiography should.
        </p>
        <p>
            A struggle, however, that I encountered was attempting to communicate with my classmates during the presentation, which is a CART Habit of Mind. Nonetheless, because each classmate of mine had to participate in public speaking, it was easier to make myself
            more comfortable and project my voice better.
