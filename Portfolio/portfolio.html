                        Using Adobe Spark, I introduced myself to my classmates and instructors at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology. To learn more about what was required of me and what I produced, please read more by clicking below!

                        Chronoshift Expeditions was my first introduction to website development on the front-end and back-end. While I had not yet been introduced to JavaScript at this point, it is vital to view my growth as a developer and compare my original projects to my
                        more recent ones.

                        Flew & Brew was the mock company I created that sold luxury vacations to different countries based on coffee experiences. I researched a country's respective culture and customs and input that information into the website. Additionally, at this point
                        in my journey as a web developer, I was finally introduced to media queries.

                        <i>End of Dragons</i> is the interactive story that I created alongside a vital teammate. Users have to make decisions along with different points in the story that will affect the story's outcome. Their choices are recorded, and
                        users are encouraged to play through all endings. At this point, I was finally introduced to JavaScript.

                        When I was applying for admission into various colleges, I addressed the prompt in the Common Application that asked about my identity. I reviewed my work with my peers and instructors, and I was successful in my adventures as I gained admission to Duke
                        University and various scholarships.

                        During my junior year of high school, I researched ADHD as an English assignment. Understanding how I write from an academic or professional standpoint is crucial to observe how I will write in the workplace. Please learn more by clicking the button down

                        Part of my identity is my home in East Los Angeles, and I love to memorialize my experiences by taking photographs. However, they are sometimes slightly unappealing due to distractions in the background, but I encourage you to see how I utilized Photoshop
                        to alter one of my girlfriend and me!
