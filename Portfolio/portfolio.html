                            Using Adobe Spark, I introduced myself to my classmates and instructors at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology. While I had not yet begun coding at this point in my journey, I still encourage you to learn more about what was required of me
                            and what I produced by clicking below!

                        Chronoshift Expeditions was my first introduction to website development on the front-end and back-end where I created a time travel company. While I had not yet been introduced to JavaScript at this point, it is vital to view my growth as a developer
                        and compare my original projects to my more recent ones.

                        Flew & Brew was the mock company I created that sold luxury vacations to different countries based on coffee experiences. I researched a country's respective culture and customs and input that information into the website. At this point in my journey
                        as a web developer, I was finally introduced to media queries.

                        <i>End of Dragons</i> is the interactive story that I created alongside a vital teammate. Users have to make decisions along with different points in the story that will affect the story's outcome. Their choices are recorded, and
                        users are encouraged to play through all endings. At this point, I was finally introduced to JavaScript.

                        During my junior year of high school, I researched ADHD as an assignment for Contemporary Issues in Education. Understanding how I write from an academic or professional standpoint is crucial to observe how I will write in the workplace. Please learn

                        Part of my identity is my home in East Los Angeles, and I love to memorialize my experiences by taking photographs. However, they are sometimes slightly unappealing due to distractions in the background, but I encourage you to see how I utilized Photoshop
                        to alter one of my girlfriend and me!

                        Creating this digital portfolio meant also keeping a log that detailed my successes and drawbacks along the way. Feel free to contact me if you do not see what you are looking for or are wanting more information, but I still encourage you to see the record
                        that I kept while creating this project!
