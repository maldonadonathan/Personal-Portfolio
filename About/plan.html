            <h2>Post-Secondary Plan</h2>
            <p>
                My inspiration and motivation are to preserve my indigenous culture and share my Mayan language with future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                To elaborate, my father decided against teaching me K'iche', our indigenous language in Guatemala, as he experienced prejudice for being indigenous, leaving him to believe that our family would be targeted for being native. However, my father's sacrifice
                meant that our culture would eventually become lessons in a history textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my childhood and young adult life, I continued to meet older relatives at family functions, yet I found that I could only respond in Spanish. I recognized that my inability to speak in our native tongue meant the possibility of my native culture
                disappearing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recognized that a movement of preservation could not be catalyzed by simply learning the language and not doing more to teach others. Nonetheless, I determined that understanding the dialect was the first step in reaching my end goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, I turned to Duke, whose Less Commonly Taught Languages program exposes me to my Mayan heritage as well as a community that values the preservation of our Mayan heritage and culture at one of few institutions in North America to offer the
                language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I draw inspiration from my understanding of human and digital languages to create technology that preserves indigenous dialects, and I hope to become a natural language processing engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                While computer science and linguistics may, at face value, appear to vary in purpose and application, the versatility of computer science and engineering has applications in linguistics. For instance, the extent to which computational linguistics could
                be utilized for language translation has yet to be realized. Consequently, at Duke and beyond, I hope to conduct research within the niche field of computational linguistics and further my understanding and involvement in translation,
                speech, and voice technologies regarding native cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interdepartmental study of linguistics and computer science guides me toward success in the field of natural language processing. By employing machine learning approaches in computer science, I will develop artificial intelligence that mimics, learns,
                and adapts to native speakers of any language and analyze the impact of my technology, vision, and x-factor.
