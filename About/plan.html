            <h2>Post-Secondary Plan</h2>
            <p>While a student at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), I completed lengthy research into who I wanted to become after high school and how to introduce myself to college life and the workforce. Therefore, I have ample resources
                if anyone is interested in seeing how I plan on achieving my goals. While I have my goals summarized below, I also encourage you to explore more by clicking the button below if you are interested in learning more!</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                My inspiration and motivation are to preserve my indigenous culture and share my Mayan language with future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                To elaborate, my father decided against teaching me K'iche', our indigenous language in Guatemala, as he experienced prejudice for being indigenous, leaving him to believe that our family would be targeted for being native. However, my father's sacrifice
                meant that our culture would eventually become lessons in a history textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my childhood and young adult life, I continued to meet older relatives at family functions, yet I found that I could only respond in Spanish. I recognized that my inability to speak in our native tongue meant the possibility of my native culture
                disappearing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recognized that a movement of preservation could not be catalyzed by simply learning the language and not doing more to teach others. Nonetheless, I determined that understanding the dialect was the first step in reaching my end goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, I turned to Duke, whose Less Commonly Taught Languages program exposes me to my Mayan heritage as well as a community that values the preservation of our Mayan heritage and culture at one of few institutions in North America to offer the
                language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I draw inspiration from my understanding of human and digital languages to create technology that preserves indigenous dialects, and I hope to become a natural language processing engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                While computer science and linguistics may, at face value, appear to vary in purpose and application, the versatility of computer science and engineering has applications in linguistics. For instance, the extent to which computational linguistics could
                be utilized for language translation has yet to be realized. Consequently, at Duke and beyond, I hope to conduct research within the niche field of computational linguistics and further my understanding and involvement in translation,
                speech, and voice technologies regarding native cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interdepartmental study of linguistics and computer science guides me toward success in the field of natural language processing. By employing machine learning approaches in computer science, I will develop artificial intelligence that mimics, learns,
                and adapts to native speakers of any language and analyze the impact of my technology, vision, and x-factor.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond university, I hope to save fleeting languages.</p>
            <h3>Two-Year plan</h3>
            <p>In two years, I hope to still be in North Carolina, studying at Duke to complete my education in Computer Science and Linguistics. By my second year in college, I hope to have already had at least one internship related to computer or data
                science that I could put on my resume and could use to get me in the door at various technology companies. In my personal life, I hope to be making larger plans to spend the rest of my life with my current girlfriend as we have been in
                a committed relationship for four years already.
            </p>
            <h3>Five-Year Plan</h3>
            <p>In five years, I hope to be beginning my doctorate degree in computer science or a related field. A doctorate would make me more competitive for work as a computer and information research scientist. However, I do not yet know which graduate
                program I would like to attend. Private institutions offer a better stipend, making Brown University and Vanderbilt University my top choices. However, if I decide to move back to Los Angeles after graduating from Duke University for my
                undergraduate degree, I hope to attend either the University of California, Los Angeles or the University of Southern California.
            </p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Become the research assistant for a STEM professor or graduate student.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue involvement in meaningful extracurricular activities, including holding course rigor inside and outside of specialization or focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hold at least two internships during the entirety of my undergraduate experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Begin to network and make connections with my fellow classmates to continue relationships, both professional and personal.
                </li>
            </ol>
