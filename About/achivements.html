                    NASAâ€™s Let Your Invention Fly Challenge Winner
                    <p>
                        Alongside a team of three, I presented a niche toolbox design for the International Space Station to a panel of judges for NASA at California State University, Fresno. The plan was modeled on SolidWorks utilizing 3D printing technology and was used in
                        a live demonstration for the judges and other finalists. After a series of eliminations, my team was chosen as the winner for our specific cohort.

                    Duke University Scholars Program
                    <p>
                        Of the 50,000 applications received by Duke University, approximately twenty were chosen as finalists for the University Scholars Program. As a finalist, I received the Duke Academic Honors Scholarship and attended finalist interviews during the March
                        of my senior year. Finally, I was named a scholar in May, 2022 for the scholarship that is valued at over $315,000.

                    Association of Mexican-American Educators Scholarship
                    <p>
                        The Association of Mexican-American Educators has encouraged Hispanic students to complete their secondary educational goals through local chapter scholarships. Twenty scholarships, however, are given to high school seniors every year. The value of the
                        scholarship is $1,000, and Hispanic students from Central Valley, California, are encouraged to apply.

                    <p>
                        Local scholarships are a foundation of community building, and I found those values within Central Valley Staffing when searching for financial opportunities to support my goals. I provided a personal statement similar to the one featured on my page,
                        and I encourage you to visit my writing!

                    AP Scholar with Distinction
                    <p>
                        Students in the AP program are contestants to become AP Scholars with Distinction; however, they must receive a 3.5 score average on earlier AP Exams with passing scores on at least five exams. I completed ten AP courses, ranging from AP U.S. Government
                        to AP Calculus.

                    California Scholarship Federation Lifetime Membership
                    <p>
                        Each semester, high school students are granted membership by receiving at least ten California Scholarship Federation points, where more points are allotted for advanced classes and higher marks. I then qualified by receiving high academic marks on each
                        report card while completing University of California Designated Honors and Advanced Placement courses.

                    California Seal of Biliteracy: French
                    <p>
                        To receive the California Seal of Biliteracy for French, I completed four years of the foreign language at the AP level and received high marks every semester of enrollment in these courses.

                    California Seal of Biliteracy: Spanish
                    <p>
                        As a native Spanish speaker, I chose not to take courses in Spanish in order to focus on learning other languages. However, I still wanted to challenge myself and decided to start at the AP level, so I enrolled in AP Spanish and AP French during my senior
                        year of high school.

                    Lifetime Perfect Attendance
                    <p>
                        Since the start of kindergarten, I have been in attendance at every one of my classes and have continued this streak well into my senior year of high school. To keep this streak, I took better care of my health and found that my academic achievements
                        correlated with my attendance.

                    Valedictorian
                    <p>
                        Every semester, the Principal's Honor Roll Award is given to students who have achieved academic excellence by receiving a 4.0. I received this honor every semester of high school, making me Valedictorian.
