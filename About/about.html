            <p>
                Welcome, everyone, my name is Nathan Maldonado, and I am a senior at Clovis North High School and soon-to-be first-year student at Duke University. I am an FGLI (first-generation, low-income) student, and I am the oldest in my family with two younger
                siblings. I currently live in Fresno, California, but I previously lived in Los Angeles, California, before high school. I am incredibly family-oriented, so I spend much of my free time at various amusement parks with them or watching
                psychological thrillers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since moving to the Central Valley, I have taken an interest in artificial intelligence and have enrolled in my high school robotics team and coding club, so I intend to study computer science and linguistics at Duke. In my first year of high school,
                I won the Let Your Invention Fly Challenge competition hosted by NASA and California State University, Fresno. However, my interest in computer science is derived from my ethnic heritage: K'iche' Maya. K'iche' is an indigenous language
                spoken in Guatemala, and very few educational tools exist to preserve the language, so I intend to utilize my background in computer science and artificial intelligence to create technology that does just that. Furthermore, I encourage
                you to navigate toward my previous works, notably my personal statement and tourism website! Don't hesitate to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmaldonado/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:nmaldonado2725@gmail.com">email</a>                if you have any concerns or are interested in hearing more about my experiences; I would love to answer all questions!

                    I have recently been inducted into the University Scholars Program at Duke University, a full-ride scholarship that includes a stipend. The scholarship supports students pursuing interdisciplinary fields, and my interest in computer science and linguistics
                    was recognized. I am grateful for all the recognition I have received, and if you are interested, I invite you to learn more.

                    Psychological thrillers are how I spend most of my free time. I try to have a decent work-life balance, so I try to also spend time with my friends and family by going out to eat at Korean barbeque spots in downtown LA and Six Flags: Magic Mountain. However,
                    my favorite places include Yosemite National Park, Little Tokyo, and Boyle Heights. If you're interested in how I spend my free time and getting to know myself as a person, please learn more!

                    In the short term, I will be graduating high school as Valedictorian and attending Duke University on a full-ride scholarship. In the long run, however, I hope to graduate with a degree in computer science and linguistics and then attend a graduate program
                    in a similar field. Ultimately, I hope to work in artificial intelligence and create technology that preserves indigenous languages. To learn more about my plan, click below!
