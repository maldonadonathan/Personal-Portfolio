            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking an interest in me, and I encourage you to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email if you are interested in learning more about what I have been up to lately. Very briefly, however, I am a first-generation, low-income student
                from Clovis North High School and the Center of Advanced Research and Technology (CART). I will attend Duke University in the fall as a "Uni" scholar and study computer science and linguistics. Ultimately, I hope to become a natural language
                processing engineer or artificial intelligence engineer to pursue my goal of language preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also hope you choose to navigate over toward achievements, hobbies, and post-secondary plans. You can find more information about all that stuff below! </p>

                    I have recently been inducted into the University Scholars Program at Duke University, a full-ride scholarship that includes a stipend. The scholarship supports students pursuing interdisciplinary fields, and my interest in computer science and linguistics
                    was recognized. I am grateful for all the recognition I have received, and if you are interested, I invite you to learn more.

                    Psychological thrillers are how I spend most of my free time. I try to have a decent work-life balance, so I try to also spend time with my friends and family by going out to eat at Korean barbeque spots in Downtown LA and Six Flags: Magic Mountain. However,
                    my favorite places include Yosemite National Park, Little Tokyo, and Boyle Heights. If you're interested in how I spend my free time and getting to know myself as a person, please learn more!

                    In the short term, I will be graduating high school as Valedictorian and attending Duke University on a full-ride scholarship. In the long run, however, I hope to graduate with a degree in computer science and linguistics and then attend a graduate program
                    in a similar field. Ultimately, I hope to work in artificial intelligence and create technology that preserves indigenous languages. To learn more about my plan, click below!
