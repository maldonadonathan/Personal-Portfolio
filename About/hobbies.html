                    Knitting
                    <p>
                        My mom first taught me to knit in my sophomore year of high school so that I could make a blanket for my girlfriend, Catherine Ugale. She is the most talented person I know, and she will be attending Johns Hopkins University next fall. I wanted to express
                        my gratitude for all that she has done for me, so I have made her and other people in my life blankets as well. My grandmother first taught my mom, and she taught me, so I am thankful to have this tradition carried on in my family.

                    Camping
                    <p>
                        Every summer since I was born, my family has gone camping in Yosemite. However, recently, the pandemic and wildfires closed the park, so we have traveled to Ventana Campground in Big Sur, California. I appreciate the time I spend with my family, and I
                        will continue this tradition with my own family in the future.

                    Psychological Thrillers
                    <p>
                        Psychological thrillers and horror movies entertain the child within me as I scratch at my brother's door later that night. As I will soon be away from my family, I cherish the moments I spent with my two younger brothers watching these films. These psychological
                        thrillers also encourage me to question various aspects of life, including what it means to deserve something. The Platform, notably, ranks amongst the highest in my personal viewing history as the plot mirrored how I view privilege
                        and the accessibility certain groups have to resources in higher education and wealth compared to other groups who were merely born into their circumstances.

                    Amusement Parks
                    <p>
                        Every summer, my family loves going to Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. I am known in my family to have the worst, most atrocious scream because I laugh viciously instead. My favorite ride is the Drop of Doom at night because viewing the park lights
                        is a surreal experience. Again, I spend most of my time here with my family and close friends. The park has acted as a haven where I can release any stress from days prior.

                    Korean BBQ
                    <p>
                        Having lived in Los Angeles, my exposure to other cultures was high. However, no meal comes close to Korean BBQ with my cousins as we laugh over our current week's stories. Despite being incapable of eating another bite, I always suggest boba milk tea
                        immediately after and am greeted with "of course" every time.
